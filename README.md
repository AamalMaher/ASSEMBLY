# encryption and decryption system


## idea of algorithm
### for encryption:
we try to use an algorithm realted to  our feild it 1`s and 0`s so we try to define capital letters,every letter define by 5 digits fom 0`s and 1`s
user enter string that have 7 capital letter and the system convert the string to  0`s and 1`s
this is every letter and it`s 5 digit from 0`s and 1`s:

#### Sample Run

### for decryption:
user can enter 20 digit from 0`s and 1`s and the system convert them to the string that equivalent to them.
#### Sample Run
