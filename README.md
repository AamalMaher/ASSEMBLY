# encryption and decryption system


## idea of algorithm
### for encryption:
we tried to use an algorithm realted to our field. This algorithm is based on  binary system (1s and 0s).  We tried to define capital letters,every letter is represented by 5 digits form 0s and 1s. user enters a string of 7 capital letter and the system convert the string to 0s and 1s. This figure shows every letter and its 5 digit corresponding representation

#### Sample Run

### for decryption:
user can enter 20 digit from 0`s and 1`s and the system convert them to the string that equivalent to them.
